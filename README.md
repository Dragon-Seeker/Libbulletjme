The Libbulletjme Project adds "glue code" to the Bullet Physics Library,
providing Java code with access to Bullet Physics functionality.

The project supports the 3 major desktop operating systems:
Windows, Linux, and OSX.  Both x86 and x64 architectures are supported for
each operating system.

### History
