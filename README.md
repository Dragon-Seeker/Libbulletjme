The Libbulletjme Project adds "glue code" to a subset of the Bullet Physics
Library, providing Java projects with access to Bullet Physics functionality.

The project supports the 3 major desktop operating systems:
Windows, Linux, and OSX.  Both x86 and x64 architectures are supported for
each operating system.

The C++ source code is provided under
[a mixed license](https://github.com/stephengold/Libbulletjme/blob/master/LICENSE).

Libbulletjme is used in [Minie].
